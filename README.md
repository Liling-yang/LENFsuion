LENFusion: A Joint Low-Light Enhancement and Fusion Network for Nighttime Infrared and Visible Image Fusion

This is official code of "[LENFusion: A Joint Low-Light Enhancement and Fusion Network for Nighttime Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10504357)".

## Before Train

> conda env create -f LENFusion.yaml

## Train

During training, **eval** is used for evaluation, and **model** is used to store the training weight.

The code has two training datasets in the **train** folder:
1. **LFN_traingdata** is the training dataset of Luminance Feedback Network (LFN). Links: [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16VLXA-aOtD_TJaVFP9qEW-2Fa-05PJW2/view?usp=drive_link) and [baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Fw6nPvlTv9A3vAOGd3D9Aw?pwd=vudc).
2.  **vi** and **ir** are the training dataset of the main networks (Luminance Adjustment Network and Re-enhancement Fusion Network, LAN and RFN). Links: [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zx4yWi_T7skTIfaJKLAmsbPjKNSzSgX/view?usp=drive_link) and [baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Q81kiIrCVACC703i1r_osQ?pwd=x6gf ).

## Test
